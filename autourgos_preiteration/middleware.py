# ── PreIterationMiddleware ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class PreIterationMiddleware(CallbackHandler):
    """
    Middleware that executes a callback and/or injects files before each
    agent iteration.

    Use this to:

    * Take a screenshot before every iteration and feed it to the LLM.
    * Refresh a live data feed, clear a cache, or ping a health endpoint.
    * Run any custom logic (sync or async) at the start of each loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    callback : callable, optional
        Sync or async ``callable(iteration: int)``. Wrap multiple callables
        with :class:`SEQUENTIAL` or :class:`PARALLEL`.
    files : str, list of str, or callable(iteration) -> str | list, optional
        File path(s) to inject into the LLM at every iteration. Pass a
        callable to generate paths dynamically (e.g. a screenshot that
        changes every iteration).
    image_quality : str or int
        Controls screenshot token cost. Options:

        * ``"auto"`` (default) — no change, backward-compatible.
        * ``"high"`` — forces ``detail="high"``, no resize.
        * ``"medium"`` — downscales to ≤768 px, JPEG q70, ``detail="auto"``.
        * ``"low"`` — downscales to ≤512 px, JPEG q60, ``detail="low"`` (~85 tokens flat).
        * ``int`` 1–100 — JPEG quality; ``detail="low"`` when ≤512 else ``"auto"``.

        Pillow is required for resize: ``pip install 'autourgos-preiteration[images]'``.
